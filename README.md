# PDFTron Sign App

PDFTron Sign App demonstrates building a signing application where users can request signatures on the documents by placing fields, sign documents, review signed documents using [PDFTron PDF SDK](https://www.pdftron.com).

This repo is designed to help getting started in creating your own signing workflow.

## Install

```
npm install
```

This application uses Firebase to store PDFs, and data for signatures. You can use any other backend of your choice. 
However, to get started with this sample, please register a new app with [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).

After you have registered an app, create `.env` file in root of the directory and place the following:

```
REACT_APP_API_KEY=your_key_goes_here
REACT_APP_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_key_goes_here
REACT_APP_APP_ID=your_key_goes_here
```

Now you can run the application and start requesting signatures.

## Run

```
npm start
```

## Build

```
npm run build
```
